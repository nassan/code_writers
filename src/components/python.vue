<br>
The only Python Tutorial you'll ever need
<br>
Programmers around the world like to joke around python that now Psudo-code finally exists.
<br>
Python is considered to be a very easy language to learn
<br>

So let's begin...




<br>
Declaring Variables:
<br>Declare an Integer:
<br>num = 5


<br>Declare a String:
<br>word = "Hello"       --- don't forget the "Quotes"


<br>Declare a Double:
<br>number = 4.5


<br>Declare a list:
<br>list1 = ["apple","orange","banana","potato"]   -For more details about lists, see below


<br>Declaring Booleans:
<br>active = True

<br>active = False

<br>-- Don't forget Caps 



<br>Interacting with user:
<br><br>Sending Info to User
<br>Printing Text:
<br>print "text of your choice"

<br>(in Python3 brackets are requireed around the printed element

<br>Printing Variables:
<br>print num

<br>print text

<br>Getting Input from User:
<br>Get Int:
<br>num = input(text)        #warning! Only numbers! Otherwise the program would crash

<br>what is put into the brackets of the input() function will be printed to the user 

<br>example:
<br>num = input("Please enter your favorite number:")

<br>Get text:
<br>text = raw_input(text)

<br>Basic Functions:
<br>Conditions:
<br>if condition :

<br>(tab) script

<br>example:
<br>if num == 0:

<br>print "The number was invalid"    

<br>Tips Tricks:
<br>In conditions never forget == when comparing to objects (the single = is made to declare a variable)

<br>when entering != the condition will be applied whenever it's Opposite 

<br>While function:
<br>while (done == )

 

<br>Conditions
<br>Tips &#38; Tricks:
<br>a != b    -when a doesn't == to b

<br>a &#60; b     -when b is larger than a (only available in integers)

<br>a > b     -when a is larger than b 

<br>a &#60;= b   -when a is equal to or smaller than b

<br>a >= b   -when a is equal to or larger than b

<br>hello
<br>with Booleans: 
<br>if active: --if active == True the statement is True (and will proceed to the next step)

<br>if !active:  --if active != True (is not True) 

<br>Note: any variable with a value always == True

<br>Lists:
<br>Adding to Lists:
<br>list1.append(item to add)

<br>list1.insert(place to add item,item to add)
