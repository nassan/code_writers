      first of all you need to know what is Java.
      Java is a programming language and computing platform. There are lots of applications and websites
      that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day.
      Java is fast, secure, and reliable.
      From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to
      scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere!</font>

       the command of printing in Java is: "system.out.println("");".
       lets say we want the computer to print us "Hello World", so what thet we need to do is writr system.out.println("Hello World");
       and then the in the bottom of the computer will see Hello World.  </font>
