The only Python Tutorial you'll ever need

Programmers around the world like to joke around python that now Psudo-code finally exists.

Python is considered to be a very easy language to learn


So let's begin...


Declare Bool 

Interacting with user 

Sending Info to User 

Printing Text 

Getting Input form User 

Basic Functions 

Lists


Declaring Variables:
Declare an Integer:
num = 5


Declare a String:
word = "Hello"       --- don't forget the "Quotes"


Declare a Double:
number = 4.5


Declare a list:
list1 = ["apple","orange","banana","potato"]   -For more details about lists, see below


Declaring Booleans:
active = True

active = False

-- Don't forget Caps 



Interacting with user:
Sending Info to User
Printing Text:
print "text of your choice"

(in Python3 brackets are requireed around the printed element

Printing Variables:
print num

print text

Getting Input from User:
Get Int:
num = input(text)        #warning! Only numbers! Otherwise the program would crash

what is put into the brackets of the input() function will be printed to the user 

example:
num = input("Please enter your favorite number:")

Get text:
text = raw_input(text)

Basic Functions:
Conditions:
if condition :

(tab) script

example:
if num == 0:

print "The number was invalid"    

Tips Tricks:
In conditions never forget == when comparing to objects (the single = is made to declare a variable)

when entering != the condition will be applied whenever it's Opposite 

While function:
while (done == )

 

Conditions
Tips &#38; Tricks:
a != b    -when a doesn't == to b

a &#60; b     -when b is larger than a (only available in integers)

a > b     -when a is larger than b 

a &#60;= b   -when a is equal to or smaller than b

a >= b   -when a is equal to or larger than b

hello
with Booleans: 
if active: --if active == True the statement is True (and will proceed to the next step)

if !active:  --if active != True (is not True) 

Note: any variable with a value always == True

Lists:
Adding to Lists:
list1.append(item to add)

list1.insert(place to add item,item to add)



      Hello here we going to learn the basic of Java.
      first of all you need to know what is Java.
      Java is a programming language and computing platform. There are lots of applications and websites
      that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day.
      Java is fast, secure, and reliable.
      From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to
      scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere!</font>
